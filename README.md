This is a digital tool which monitors stock levels and stores information on books, publishers and book categories.


You can add, edit and delete books and publishers as desired, but be aware that deleting a publisher will also remove all the books printed by that publisher.


This service also offers an image-aided book search for your browsing convenience.
